# Project 0

I used my summer holiday this year to make this project. The content is mainly about where
I have been during this one month trip and some pictures.

There are five web pages about the whole trip.  
1. General summary, index.html
2. Part 1, China.html
3. Part 2, Singapore.html
4. Part 3, KL.html
5. Part 4, Bankok.html

The index.html can go to all others. Each sub part can go to the index.html and the previous part.

There are two style sheets. One is mystyle.scss, the sass stylesheet. The other is mystyle.css, the css
file generated by mystyle.scss file.
